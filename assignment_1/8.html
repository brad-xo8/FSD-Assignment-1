                His book Poverty and Un-British Rule in India[3] brought attention to his theory of the Indian "wealth drain" into Britain. He was also a member of the Second International along with Kautsky and Plekhanov. In 2014, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg inaugurated the Dadabhai Naoroji Awards for services to UK-India relations.[4] India Post depicted Naoroji on stamps in 1963, 1997 and 2017
